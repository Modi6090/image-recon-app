🔌 API Integration (Planned)
This project is prepared for integrating APIs such as:

Google Cloud Vision (for object or text recognition)

Clarifai (for tag-based image insights)

Tesseract.js (for OCR)

Any custom ML API (Flask/FastAPI)

Example integration steps will be added once the API is connected.
